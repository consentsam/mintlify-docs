Below is our **phased** approach to rolling out and scaling LearnLedger. We aim to prove our concept with early partners, then expand to major edtech players and beyond.

## Phase 1: Initial Protocol Launch
- **Objective**: Deploy core smart contracts (staking, refund mechanism, SBT issuance).  
- **Deliverables**:
  - Smart contract audits.
  - Pilot course to test staking and SBT minting.
  - Basic on-chain progress tracking.
- **Timeline**: Q1 2025 (tentative).

## Phase 2: Pilot Integrations with Early Adopters
- **Objective**: Integrate with 1–2 smaller edtech platforms.  
- **Deliverables**:
  - API endpoints for partner platforms to update student progress.
  - Real-world feedback on user experience and potential improvements.
- **Timeline**: Q2 2025.

## Phase 3: Large-Scale Partner Onboarding
- **Objective**: Approach major edtech platforms once the concept is validated.  
- **Deliverables**:
  - Enhanced tokenomics model with partial refunds, dynamic staking rates.
  - Marketing campaigns to attract thousands of learners.
- **Timeline**: Q3–Q4 2025.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Growth
- **Objective**: Expand the ecosystem to include mentors, recruiters, content creators.  
- **Deliverables**:
  - Additional reward systems for contributions (e.g., content bounties).
  - Partnerships with recruiters leveraging SBT credentials for hiring.
- **Timeline**: 2026 onward.

## Future Possibilities
- **Micro-Credentials & NFTs**: More granular, skill-based certifications beyond SBTs.  
- **Global Expansion**: Multi-language support, broader outreach to educational institutions worldwide.

> **Note**: Timelines are subject to change based on pilot feedback, market conditions, and partnership availability.
