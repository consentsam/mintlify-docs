Welcome to **LearnLedger**, a blockchain-driven protocol that aims to **democratize education**. We do this by allowing learners to stake our native token, **LLEDU**, instead of paying course fees in fiat. Once a learner completes a course, those staked tokens are returned—effectively making the course _free_ for any student who follows through to completion.

## Why LearnLedger?

- **Increase Course Completion Rates**: With tokens on the line, learners have more incentive to finish the course.
- **Build Trust with On-Chain Credentials**: Students receive **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** as proof of completion—these are non-transferable certificates stored on-chain.
- **Scalable Ecosystem**: We integrate with existing edtech platforms, enabling them to harness the power of blockchain without overhauling their user experience.

## Core Vision

1. **Access to Quality Education**  
   We believe in removing financial barriers. By staking (and returning) tokens, students get an effectively free learning experience.

2. **Seamless Integrations**  
   We’re working to make our blockchain-based features (staking, SBTs, etc.) feel as frictionless as traditional edtech platforms.

3. **Ecosystem Growth**  
   After proving the concept with smaller partners, we plan to onboard major edtech players, mentors, content creators, recruiters, and more—all under one incentivized ecosystem.

> **Key Takeaway**:  
> LearnLedger transforms the traditional “pay to enroll” model into a “stake and learn” model, making online education more accessible and completion-driven.
