# Platform Fundamentals & Terminology

This section defines the core building blocks of LearnLedger and the unique terms you’ll encounter.

## LLEDU Token

- **Native Token**: LLEDU is the backbone of our platform. Instead of paying a course fee, learners stake LLEDU when they enroll.  
- **Returning Staked Tokens**: Upon completion, the staked tokens are unlocked and returned to the learner’s wallet.  
- **Partial Refunds**: If a student doesn’t finish the course, some or all tokens might remain locked (which then returned to the protocol) or be partially refunded.

## Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)

- **Non-Transferable Credentials**: SBTs are on-chain proof of course completion. They can’t be sold or moved to another wallet.  
- **Issued on Completion**: As soon as the student completes the course, the SBT is minted into the learner’s wallet.  
- **Verifiable Achievements**: Potential employers or educators can verify these SBTs on-chain, ensuring the authenticity of credentials.

## Roles in the Ecosystem

- **Learners**: Individuals who stake LLEDU to access course content.  
- **Educators/Content Creators**: Provide courses and content; in later phases, they may receive LLEDU rewards for high-quality content.  
- **Partner Platforms**: Edtech sites or learning management systems (LMS) that integrate LearnLedger’s staking and SBT issuance.  

## Progress Sync

- **API Calls**: Partner platforms periodically call our API to update the learner’s progress.  
- **Smart Contract Updates**: Each API call triggers on-chain updates to reflect new token statuses (staked, unlocked, withdrawable).
