description: How LLEDU powers the LearnLedger ecosystem
---

LearnLedger’s token model incentivizes course completion and drives ecosystem growth.

## Staking Mechanism

1. **Enrollment**: When a learner starts a course, they stake a predefined amount of LLEDU.  
2. **Lock-in Period**: These tokens stay locked (partially or fully) until the learner completes the course or drops out.  
3. **Refund Policy**: 
   - **Full Refund**: If the learner completes the course successfully, 100% of the staked tokens are unlocked.  
   - **Partial Refund**: Some courses might offer partial refunds based on the percentage of completion.  
   - **Non-Refundable**: All the staked tokens which hasn't been unlocked are redistributed to the platform if a learner quits early (depending on the partner’s policy).

## Circulation & Demand

- **Course Participation**: Each time a new student enrolls, they need LLEDU, creating demand.  
- **Incentives for Completion**: High course completion rates enhance the platform’s reputation, attracting more learners and thus more demand for LLEDU.  
- **Platform Revenue** (future phases): Certain advanced features or premium content might require small fees paid in LLEDU, further driving usage.

## Ecosystem Effects

- **Positive Feedback Loop**: More platforms onboard → more students stake LLEDU → higher token demand → more visibility → more partners.  
- **SBT Credentials**: As SBTs become recognized in the job market or among partner platforms, the utility of LLEDU as a gateway to verifiable education increases.

## Long-Term Outlook

Eventually, once large-scale edtech platforms join, we expect:
- **Stable Token Value**: Driven by consistent demand and utility.  
- **Broader Use Cases**: Possibly leveraging LLEDU for mentorship programs, content creation bounties, or even recruitment incentives.
