description: How we collaborate with edtech platforms and what it takes to integrate LearnLedger
---


LearnLedger’s success hinges on **partner platforms** that adopt our staking and SBT issuance model. We strive to make integrations as seamless as possible.

## Current Partners

- **Platform TeachNook & Platform Verizio** (Pilot Phase)  
  - Testing course enrollment flows.  
  - Gathering user feedback on staking/refunds.

## Integration Process

1. **API Access**: Each partner is given unique credentials to interact with our REST endpoints.  
2. **Wallet Linking**: Students link a crypto wallet during sign-up or checkout on the partner’s platform.  
3. **Progress Sync**: As learners move through modules, the partner platform calls our “Update Progress” endpoint.  
4. **Course Completion**: On final completion, a “Course Completed” endpoint triggers token refunds and SBT minting.

## Future Integrations

- **Major Edtech Platforms**: Once we prove higher completion rates and user satisfaction with early adopters, we aim to partner with industry leaders.  
- **Universities & Institutions**: Long-term, we envision recognized universities offering official courses with SBT credentials recognized globally.

## Benefits for Partners

- **Higher Course Completion**: The staked token model motivates students to follow through.  
- **Marketing Advantage**: “Study for Free” is a compelling message, as staked tokens are returned upon completion.  
- **On-Chain Credentials**: Graduates can share their SBT achievements with potential employers, boosting the platform’s reputation.
