title: Protocol Features & SBT Integration
description: Detailed look at the core LearnLedger features and how SBTs work
---


LearnLedger’s main innovations are **token staking for enrollment** and **SBT issuance for completion**. Below is a closer look at these features in action.

## Course Enrollment Flow

1. **Select a Course** on a partner platform.  
2. **Connect Wallet**: The learner’s wallet must hold sufficient LLEDU to stake.  
3. **Stake Tokens**: Upon enrollment, the required tokens are locked in the smart contract.  
4. **Learning Progress**: As the student completes modules, the partner platform calls LearnLedger APIs to update on-chain progress.

## On-Chain Progress Tracking

- **Milestone Checkpoints**: If a course has multiple modules, partial unlocking can occur upon each milestone.  
- **Security & Transparency**: Because it’s on-chain, learners can view their staked vs. unlocked token balances in real time.

## SBT Issuance

1. **Completion Trigger**: Once the final module is completed, the partner platform sends a “course finished” signal to our protocol.  
2. **SBT Minting**: A non-transferable token is minted to the learner’s wallet, permanently recording their achievement.  
3. **Zero Financial Cost**: The learner’s staked LLEDU is returned, making it effectively free (assuming full completion).

## Platform Implementation Notes

- **API Endpoints**: Partner platforms integrate using REST calls to update progress.  
- **Smart Contracts**: The staking and SBT contracts are the backbone. They handle token logic, ensure immutability, and automate refunds or partial unlocking.

> **Why Soulbound?**  
> We use SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) instead of regular NFTs to ensure the credential remains tied to the original learner—no resale, no fraudulent transfers.
