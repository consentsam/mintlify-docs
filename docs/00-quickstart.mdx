# Quickstart

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through the essential steps to understand how LearnLedger works:

1. **Obtain LLEDU tokens** (test or mainnet).
2. **Stake tokens** to enroll in a course.
3. **Complete the course** to unlock your tokens.
4. **Receive a Soulbound Token (SBT)** as proof of completion.

After this, you can dive deeper into our [Tokenomics](#) and [Roadmap](#) sections for more info.
