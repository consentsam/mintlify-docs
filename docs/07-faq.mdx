description: Common queries about LearnLedger, LLEDU, and SBTs
---

## 1. How does staking make the course free?
When you stake LLEDU, those tokens are locked. Once you complete the course, **100%** (or a specified portion) of your tokens are unlocked and returned, effectively making the net cost zero for successful learners.

## 2. What if I don’t finish the course?
If you drop out, the refund amount depends on the course’s policy. You might receive a partial refund for partially completed milestones, or you may forfeit your staked tokens entirely.

## 3. Why use SBTs instead of NFTs?
Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) **cannot** be transferred or sold, ensuring that the credential truly belongs to the learner who earned it. This prevents fraudulent “buying” or “selling” of certifications.

## 4. How do I handle my wallet and private keys?
You need a compatible crypto wallet to stake and receive tokens. **Keep your private keys secure**—if you lose them, you lose access to any staked or returned tokens.

## 5. Can I stake any ERC-20 token for a course?
Currently, only **LLEDU** is supported. In future expansions, we may explore multi-token staking, but LLEDU is the standard for now.

## 6. Are there any transaction fees (gas fees)?
Yes, typical blockchain usage fees apply. However, we are exploring Layer 2 solutions and gas subsidies to keep fees as low as possible for learners.

## 7. When do I get my SBT?
Your SBT is minted immediately after the partner platform confirms that you have met all completion criteria.

## 8. Where can I get LLEDU tokens?
During early phases, we may offer tokens through a faucet or testnet. Eventually, LLEDU will be available on supported exchanges or via direct purchase.
